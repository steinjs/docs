description: Learn how to use the Stein CLI.
---

At the moment, the Stein CLI is still in development and quite barebones. It is ready with commands required for developing a Stein project, but it is missing some quality of life features.

## Usage
There are several ways to use the CLI. For the initial project setup, it is recommended to use a tool like `npx`, as shown in the [Getting Started](/docs/core/getting-started) guide.
Inside your project, you can use the CLI directly from the command line using your package manager (e.g. `pnpm stein`).

If you frequently use the CLI, you can install it globally using your package manager, e.g.:
```bash
npm install -g @steinjs/cli
```
Now you will have the `stein` command available everywhere on your system. The commands referenced below will assume that you have installed the CLI globally.

## Commands
The CLI currently has the following commands:

### Create
Scaffold a new Stein project using a simple step by step wizard. Heavily inspired by the [Astro CLI]() and powered by [Clack]().

```bash
stein create
```

### Add
Add integrations (plugins and tools) to your existing Stein project. Automatically adds required plugins, config files and depdendencies. The command accepts multiple arguments, allowing you to install all integrations you want at once.

```bash
stein add <integrations...>
```

### Dev
Start the development server for your project (powered by Vite).

```bash
stein dev
```

### Build
Build your project for production. The output is a SPA (single page application) which can be deployed to any static hosting service (e.g. GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.).

```bash
stein build
```



## Planned commands and improvements
- [x] `stein add` - Add a plugin to an existing project
- [ ] Improvements to the `create` command
- And more (we are open to suggestions!)

We want to build a CLI that is easy to use and powerful at the same time. If you have any suggestions, please open an issue or a pull request on GitHub.
