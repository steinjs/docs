Open Source is one of our core values. We believe in the power of open source and we want to give back to the community that has given us so much.
That's why all of our projects are open source and we encourage you to contribute to them.

## Contributors
At the moment, we are a small team of just two contributors:
- Vexcited: came up with the idea, created the library core and the currently available plugins
- Trobo: working on everything else around the library, such as the CLI and this docs site

We are part of [catto labs](https://cattolabs.com), a small team of developers that are passionate about open source and building great software.

## Discord
If you want to get in touch with the community and stay up to date, feel free to join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/BFTHz4x9UJ). This is where you can chat with us, get some insights into the current state of development and ask any questions.

If you do not want to join the server and have any questions or just want to chat with us, you can message any of the core maintainers on Discord:
- vexcited
- trobo.tech

We are open to any suggestions or feedback you might have so do not hesitate to reach out!
