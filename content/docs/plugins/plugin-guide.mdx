Stein plugins are built on top of Vite plugins. This means that you can use all the power of Vite plugins to create your own plugin.
Please refer to the [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/api-plugin.html) for more information on how to create a Vite plugin.

Then, you can copy one of the folders in the [plugins directory of the Stein repository](https://github.com/steinjs/stein/tree/main/plugins) and include all logic for your plugin in the `index.ts` file.
For more insights, you can reference the [TailwindCSS plugin](https://github.com/steinjs/stein/tree/main/plugins/tailwindcss) as an example.
