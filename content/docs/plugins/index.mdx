Stein plugins are the core of our framework. They are responsible for providing the functionality that makes Stein so powerful.


They are built on top of Vite with an extra layer of abtraction added to make things feel like magic. 
Inspired by Nuxt's plugin system, installing something like TailwindCSS is as simple as adding the plugin, with no extra setup required. 
All plugins provide opinionated defaults that help you get started quickly, but will ultimately be overridable.

## Available plugins
Currently, Stein has the following plugins available:
<Cards>
  <Card title="TailwindCSS Plugin" href="/docs/plugins/tailwindcss" />
  <Card title="UnoCSS Plugin" href="docs/plugins/unocss" />
</Cards>

We are working on more plugins and we are open to suggestions. If you have any ideas or wish to contribute a plugin yourself, feel free to reach out to us.
