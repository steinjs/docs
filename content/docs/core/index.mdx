Welcome to the Stein documentation. Here you will find all the information you need to get started with Stein.
If you want to learn more about Stein and why it was created, please read our [motivation](/docs/core/motivation).

## Creating a new project
Follow this guide to quickly get started with Stein.

**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js 18.0.0 or higher
- Text editor (VSCode, Sublime, Atom, etc.)
- Terminal (PowerShell, CMD, Bash, etc.)

If you have all of these prerequisites, you are ready to start building your project.
Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new project:

<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm", "bun"]}>
```bash tab="npm"
npx @steinjs/cli create
```

```bash tab="yarn"
yarn dlx @steinjs/cli create
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpx @steinjs/cli create
```

```bash tab="bun"
bunx @steinjs/cli create
```
</Tabs>

The process will look something like this:

After you have created your project, you can enter the project directory and start the development server with the following command:

<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm", "bun"]}>
```bash tab="npm"
npm run dev
```

```bash tab="yarn"
yarn dev
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm dev
```

```bash tab="bun"
bun dev
```
</Tabs>

Now you can open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your project.
You should see a basic page appear in your browser.

You are now ready for development! You can start building your project by editing the files in the `src` directory using your preferred code editor.
