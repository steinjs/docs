We aim to create a framework that simplifies the initial project setup and provides a rich experience for a SolidJS SPA.
Our core philosophy is "do one thing and do it well", and in this case we just want an experience which is close to building a SPA using just Vite, but with some extra bells and whistles to improve developer experience. 
We are not trying to compete with the current offerings in the ecosystem but rather provide an alternative with some opiniated defaults provided by us.

## What we're trying to build
- A solid foundation for your SolidJS SPA
- Improved project scaffolding and setup using the CLI
- Modular plugin system with plug and play experience (inspired by Nuxt)

As we do not want to reinvent the wheel, Stein is a thin layer built on top of Vite to provide a better developer experience when building SolidJS SPAs.
We do not change the SolidJS fundamentals, so vendor lock-in is not an issue. If you wish to replace Stein with plain Vite, you are free to do so (but we hope you won't).

## Vision for the future
- Unique plugins that integrate with minimal/no extra setup (Devtools, API Routes, ...)
- Rich plugin ecosystem built by the community
- and more... (you can help us build it!)

This vision is not set in stone, and we are open to suggestions and feedback from the community. We are building a framework that we want to use ourselves, and we hope you will enjoy using it as well.
