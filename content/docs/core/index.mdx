Welcome to the Stein documentation. Here you will find all the information you need to get started with Stein.
If you want to learn more about Stein and why it was created, please read our [motivation](/docs/core/motivation).

## Creating a new project
Follow this guide to quickly get started with Stein.

**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js 18.0.0 or higher
- Text editor (VSCode, Sublime, Atom, etc.)
- Terminal (PowerShell, CMD, Bash, etc.)

If you have all of these prerequisites, you are ready to start building your project.
Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new project:

<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm", "bun"]}>
```bash tab="npm"
npm init stein
```

```bash tab="yarn"
yarn create stein
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm create stein
```

```bash tab="bun"
bun create stein
```
</Tabs>

The process will look something like this:

If you encounter any issues, try running the command using `stein@latest` to ensure you are using the latest version of the CLI. If your issue persists, please open an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/steinjs/stein/issues).

## Development server
After you have created your project, you can enter the project directory and start the development server with the following command:

<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm", "bun"]}>
```bash tab="npm"
npm run dev
```

```bash tab="yarn"
yarn dev
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm dev
```

```bash tab="bun"
bun dev
```
</Tabs>

Now you can open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your project.
You should see a basic page appear in your browser.

You are now ready for development! You can start building your project by editing the files in the `src` directory using your preferred code editor.

## What's next
Now that you have created a new project successfully, you can start building your project.
