Stein was created to fill a niche in the Solid.js community. We aim to create a framework that simplifies the initial project setup and provides a rich experience for a Solid.js SPA.
SolidStart is a great choice if you wish to use SSR, but if you prefer using an SPA, Stein is the right choice for you.
