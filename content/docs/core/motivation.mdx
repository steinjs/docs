Stein was created to fill a niche in the SolidJS community. We aim to create a framework that simplifies the initial project setup and provides a rich experience for a SolidJS SPA.
SolidStart is a great choice if you wish to use SSR, but if you prefer using an SPA, Stein is the right choice for you.

## What we're trying to build
- A solid foundation for your SolidJS SPA
- Improved project scaffolding and setup using the CLI
- Modular plugin system with plug and play experience (inspired by Nuxt)

As we do not want to reinvent the wheel, Stein is a thin layer built on top of Vite to provide a better developer experience when building SolidJS SPAs.
We do not change the SolidJS fundamentals, so vendor lock-in is not an issue. If you wish to replace Stein with plain Vite, you are free to do so (but we hope you won't).

## Vision for the future
- Unique plugins that integrate with minimal/no extra setup (Devtools, API Routes, ...)
- Rich plugin ecosystem built by the community
- and more... (you can help us build it!)

This vision is not set in stone, and we are open to suggestions and feedback from the community. We are building a framework that we want to use ourselves, and we hope you will enjoy using it as well.
